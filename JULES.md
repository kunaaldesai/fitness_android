# JULES TO DO LIST
## INTRO
Hello Jules. This is the file where you will be able to see the to do list for scheduled tasks. If there is nothing listed here, then do not do anything for this run. 

## Unit Tests
Hey Codex, replace this text here and explain to Jules (an AI agent that runs scheduled tasks) how to run the tests and to maintain them. like:
- Make sure the unit tests are passing and up to date. workouts.py, users.py, and workouts_helpers.py will let you see what the backend endpoints look like, so that you can adjust the mock data if something, like the type of a field, has changed.

## TO DO
Task 1
- Complete README.md with an introduction and a folder structure for the codebase. Also, explain how to set it up at the end.
